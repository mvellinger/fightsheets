A free practice sheet to put next to you when you practice your execution skills.
Instructions are on the page itself.

# How do I use this?

It's easy!

1. Download the zip file with the [latest version of Fightsheets](https://github.com/mvellinger/fightsheets/releases) and print a few copies. You will also want some coloured pencils or pens (5 colors is ideal, I use red, orange, yellow, green and blue myself)

2. Write down the moves or combos you want to practice, and how many repetitions, under regular sets. For example: "j. HP, b+MP, HP xx HP DP" and "10" for Ken.

3. (optional) Fill out the colour key box, the colour keys will help you visualize how well you are doing, so pick accordingly; I use blue, green, yellow, orange and red. In that order. Why is that? you'll see when you start using the sheet!

4. Now, get practicing! Try to execute your move/combo perfectly a number of times equal to the repetitions you wrote down. If you mess one up; start the set over. When you're done, colour the box with the colour that corresponds to how many attempts it took you (see your colour key). There is a box for every day of the week, and for either side of the screen.

5. At the end of the week, it's time to add up the scores for each Set you've been practicing. You will find a points value under each box of the colour key. Add up the values for each exercise and write them in the "score" box on the right.

6. Find the two HIGHEST scores (these are the exercises you did the worst at) and write them under the "Focus sets" header on your next practice sheet. You will be practicing these two TWICE as much the next week!

7. If you fill an entire exercise with "1 attempt" for a week (or if you're confident you've mastered it) you can drop the exercise and write a new one for yourself.


# Is this not a lot of work?

Short answer: Yes. But practice makes perfect. 

Long answer: Yes, however you will note that, unless you've written a bunch of exercises that you cannot execute *at all*, going through the whole series of sets will probably only take you 15-20 minutes. That's not really a whole lot of time out of your day is it?. If you're finding your practice is taking very long due to failing to complete sets over and over again you should probably split your combo into two parts and practice those first.
